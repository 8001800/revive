\begin{abstract}
Two-way payment channels have been designed and linked together to construct payment networks to allow payment routing between parties that are not directly connected. A problem that members of this architecture might face is the need to rebalance ledgers. Forming a subnetwork of payment channels which allows for off-chain simultaneous rebalancing of connected channels would alleviate the problem. Implementation of this concept on the Ethereum block chain rather than Bitcoin can greatly simplify the model.
\end{abstract}

The design for bitcoin proposes using revocable secrets to proceed with off-chain payments. A design for Ethereum can make use of signatures and round numbers to greatly simplify off-chain interactions and dispute settlement.
